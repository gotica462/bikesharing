# BIKE SHARING

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal using tableu to show visualizations of how the program works using the data of New York City.

## Results

After changing the tripduration data to get the time in hours and minutes using Pandas, we get the following results:

# Checkout time by Users

As we can see the bike's user tent to use it for only half and hour. The bikes are only use for short trips.

# Checkout time by Genders

Male users tend to use the bikecity share ride more than woman. (about 2.5 times more)

# Trip Weekdays per Hour

During the Weekdays we can see that the service is most used between the hours of 6 a.m to 8 a.m in the morning and between the hours of 5 p.m to 7 p.m in the evening. We can assume most people use the service to get to work and after work to return home. During the weekends users prefer to use the service during the day.

# User trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

We can see from this graph that male users tend to use the service more than females, so we should focus our campaign to try to incorporate more women to use the service

# User trips by Gender by Weekday

We can see this graph that male users are still more inclined to use the bike city ride service, and we can see that the most popular days to use the sevivice by both genders is Thursday and Friday

# Top Starting and Top Ending locations.

This chart help us know the more popular spots in the city wher people pick and drop the bikes. Therefore, where most bikes are needed.

# Bike Utilization

From this graph we can determine which are the bikes more used, so we can determine the ammount of repairs needed. 

## Summary

Based on the visualizations we can determine:

- Bikes are used for only 30 minutes. 
- Most users are males. (about 2.5 more times than females)
- During the weekdays most people use the bikes to get to work and to get from work. 
- During the weekend people use the service during the day
- The most popular days to use the service are Thursday and Friday.
- We can track the most popular locations where people can drop and pick up their bikes.

Based on the visualizations we can see that people use the service to avoid traffic going to work so we could create a marketing campaign around that.


Aditional visualizations we could use are the Bike Utiliation rate, so we can know how often does the bike needs repair, change the tires etc. We could focus on those in the top locations. 
Another visualization we could use is the average distance between trips by users, because this will also help us to determine the repairs.
